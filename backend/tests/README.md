# Backend API Test Scripts

## How to Run

1. Make sure your local server (XAMPP, etc.) is running and the backend is accessible at `http://localhost/Projects/TSU-ID-Scheduling-System/backend/`.
2. In a terminal, navigate to this `tests/` directory.
3. Run a test script with:

    php test_register.php
    php test_login.php
    php test_get_students.php

Each script will print the API response to the console.
